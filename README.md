Acknowledgements: We thank the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa (Te Papa) for funding the wet lab genetics research, technician time and bioinformatics, and Massey University for hosting one of us (SP), for the current study. We thank the following institutions for funding and supporting the overarching Myosotis research project, including field work and taxonomic research:the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment’s Science and Innovation Group, Manaaki Whenua – Landcare Research, Te Papa, the Hutton Fund, and the Department of Conservation. We gratefully acknowledge several landowners, iwi and the Department of Conservation who allowed access to field sites to collect specimens for this study over the last ~12 years, and the Department of Conservation who authorised field work under Manaaki Whenua – Landcare Research concession CA-31615-OTH. A special thank you to all those who assisted HMM and JMP with field work, particularly Antony Kusabs (former Te Papa Collection Manager Botany), as well as Dirk Albach, Graeme Atkins, John Barkla, Marilyn Barkla, Charlotte Boyt, Ilse Breitwieser, Hamish Brown, Mary Bruce, Zuri Burns, Di Carter, Paul Cashmore, Jan Clayton-Greene, Shannel Courtney, Michael Douglas, Chris Ecroyd, Alex Fergus, Kerry Ford, Adele Gilchrist, Jane Gosden, Phil Garnock-Jones, Peter Heenan, John Hobbs, Rowan Hindmarsh-Walls, Melissa Hutchison, Carlos Lehnebach, Mike Lusk, Melissa Jager, Justin Liu, Alan Lee, David Lyttle, Cathy Jones, Daniel Kimber, Emily King, Kristina MacDonald, Alan Mark, Santiago Martín-Bravo, Alicia McCarthy, Todd McLay, Atamira Nuku, Emma Lewis, Colin Miskelly, Chris Morse, Colin Ogle, Dhana Pillai, Kay Pilkington, Tim Poupart, Brian Rance, Mathew Rees, Kalinka Rexer-Huber, Geoff Rogers, Sam Rowland, Cara-Lisa Schloots, Alice Shanks, Tony Silbery, Barbara Simpson, Neill Simpson, Nick Singers, Barry Sneddon, Rebecca Stanley, Rebecca Teele, Jon Terry, Mike Thorsen, David Toole, Simon Walls, Tui Warmenhoven, Wiremu Wharepapa, Rainer Vogt, Hugh Wood and Andreas Zeller. Thanks to herbarium HO who allowed destructive sampling from their specimens, Jonathan Frericks and Cliff Keilty at Percy Scenic Reserve (Hutt City Council, Wellington, New Zealand) for allowing and supporting sampling of their living collection. We are especially grateful to Xiaoxiao Lin at the Massey Genome Service. We wish to acknowledge the use of New Zealand eScience Infrastructure (NeSI; https://www.nesi.org.nz) high performance computing facilities, consulting support, and training services as part of this research. New Zealand's national facilities are provided by NeSI and funded jointly by NeSI's collaborator institutions and through the Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment's Research Infrastructure programme. We also thank Neil Dixon and James Hall of Te Papa’s IT team for support using NeSI at Te Papa.
